Spark-Blinds
============

Spark (arduino code) for smartthings window blinds

This project is to accompany Smartthings and the Spark Core Blinds device type
This project will control an analog servo with both on off and positional settings

To use this code use the Smartthings ide to create a new device type entitled Spark Core Blinds
  Insert the Spark Core Blinds code into the device type code 
  
  Then use the Spark Core code and flash the code to the spark core.  Setup the Spark Core to the servo on pin A7 (or change the code to be something else)  It is good to note that this is coded to an analog servo.
